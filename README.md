# Svelte resume website

This started as a static HTML website for a class, but then I adapted it into a Vite Svelte site with json-server so I could practice some basics with the framework and with styling components in Bootstrap/Sveltestrap. It employs a component based architecture in Svelte and mostly just contains some basic information about me, about a few production projects, and about web development packages I've found useful. It could turn into a more thorough blog/resume/project-catalog in the future if I come back to this project or add some subdomains, but for now I am happy with it. Check it out when you have a chance -- there's a lot of good information in there!

This site is actually deployed in a EC2 instance! You can find it at [harrisondcole.click](harrisondcole.click). This acts as the "root" domain and I own a few subdomains (e.g. startup, simon) that are linked to this instance.
