    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Harrison Cole and I from Vancouver, WA. I am an aspiring
      web programmer, developer, and entrepreneur, and am currently finishing up
      my degree in Computer Science at BYU. I will be graduating in April which
      is really exciting! I am passionate about learning new technologies and
      making software ideas realities. Right now I work as a web developer for
      3jlabs, which has been a great experience! I might link some of the
      projects I have worked on here in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of programming, I enjoy being outdoors and playing sports,
      especially basketball and tennis. I also enjoy reading, playing the piano,
      and singing. I come from a family of 6, and am the oldest of 4 kids with a
      dog and 2 birds, which also keeps me busy.

    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>
      Frankly, this website is probably more for me than it is for you.
      Originally, it was an static HTML site that I created as part of an
      introductory CS class, but as I still own the domain and virtual server, I
      wanted to (a) get some basic practice with Svelte, and (b) document some
      packages, technologies, and ideas about web development. Think of it as my
      waystation for web development. Check out some of the content below and on
      other tabs!
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I imagined annotating and creating different subdomain projects
      with different frameworks under this domain, and I may come back to that,
      but my attention has mostly been on other independent projects. You can
      check out some of my public repos and project boards on my GitHub:
