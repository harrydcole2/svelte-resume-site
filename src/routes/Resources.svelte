    <h2>Additional Web Resources</h2>
    <p>
      This tab documents some helpful technologies and packages I've been
      exposured to in the realm of web development. I tried to organize them
      according to their role in the tech stack, e.g. front-end, back-end,
      database, etc. Most of them will apply primarily to a React and C# stack,
      which is where I am most comfortable, but I tried to find a couple analogs
      where possible. The idea is to not reinvent the wheel when it comes to web
      development. Eventually may convert this to a more practical NPM package
      and documentation or create a boilerplate based on these technologies.
