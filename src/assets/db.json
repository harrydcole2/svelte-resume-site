As the name suggests, the business logic is a blackjack simulator that you can bet pseudo money against. It taught me a lot about the DOM and events in the browser. You can login/register, see others earnings online (via websockets), look at a scoreboard, and play blackjack (of course).",

More than anything, it act as a great resource for understanding how projects are built and deployed and the elements that go into a good web application. While Simon is a simple concept, there are a lot of features in the site that are added as examples of something more scalable, e.g. working with sound, making requests to an API, communication between users, etc.",
