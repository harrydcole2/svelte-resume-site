        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey! My name is Harrison Cole and I am from Camas, Washington. I am the
          oldest of four kids and have a dog and two birds at home. Growing up in
          the great northwest, I love doing anything outdoors especially hiking and
          climbing. In high school I played tennis and basketball and participated
          in choir as well.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring web programmer and am currently studying computer science
          here at BYU. My goal for my education is to learn about new perspectives 
          and ideas that will inform how I see the world and what I can add to it; 
          to be as prepared as I can be to support a family and manage effective 
          relationships with others; and to find things I am passionate about 
          learning and doing in my work and my leisure time. I am discovering that 
          computer science is where these joint goals intersect. And I continue to
          learn a lot about myself every day.
